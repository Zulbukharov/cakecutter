## ðŸ‘€ What is Cakecutter?
Sometimes, the most difficult thing is to just get started with a project. Cakecutter is a tool that helps you to cut the cake and start your amazing project instantly. 

What Cakecutter does:
- Users can [publish](http://docs.cakes.run/en/installation/), [create](http://docs.cakes.run/en/creating-cakes/) or [use a cake](http://docs.cakes.run/en/using-cakes/) from [Cakes.run](https://cakes.run). Cakes are basically TOML files which contain all the information needed to create a project. 
- According to the information in the `Cakefile`, Cakecutter will create all the files and (you can also fill them with content) in the correct location.
- Setup commands (installing dependencies, etc.) can be defined in the `Cakefile`. These commands are run after the files are generated.
- Cakecutter can ask questions to the user and take input. The input can then be used as variables for the project template. [Read the docs here](http://docs.cakes.run/en/advanced-usage/)
- Read the [Basic example cake](http://docs.cakes.run/en/example/) and [/examples/Python.toml] the Python Cake to see how Cakes are written.
